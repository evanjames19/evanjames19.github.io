        <h2>Neuromodulation and Neural Oscillations</h2>
        <p>
            Advances in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and brain stimulation has permitted an unprecedented view of how specific brain structures communicate as well as organize complex cognitive functions.
             Specifically, neurotransmitters (including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine) have all been shown to have an impact on neural oscillations throughout the brain, linking them to changes in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive function. While these interactions are still widely unexplored, their appearance in neurological disorders through cross-frequency coupling (CFC) brings light to the vital role they play in orchestrating healthy brain function.
            </p>
<p>            My research currently looks at how optogenetic activation & inhbition of these neuromodulatory centers can control and modulate cortical oscillatory dynamics. These hypotheses hope to answer important questions about how brain stimulation can provide control over the synchronization of cortical EEG signals, allowing brain stimulation to be optimized to enhance specific cognitive functions.
</p>
<p> If this sounds interesting please read my recent review/perspective paper about each neuromodulatory system's involvement in shaping these oscillations, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/12/3/371" target="_blank">Neuromodulation of Neural Oscillations in Health and Disease </a></p>
<h2>Noradrenergic and Cholinergic Interplay in Cognitive Functions</h2>
<p>
    The noradrenergic and cholinergic modulation of functionally distinct regions of the brain has become one of the primary organizational principles behind understanding the contribution of each system to the diversity of neural computation in the central nervous system. Decades of work has shown that a diverse family of receptors, stratified across different brain regions, and circuit-specific afferent and efferent projections play a critical role in helping such widespread neuromodulatory systems obtain substantial heterogeneity in neural information processing. This review briefly discusses the anatomical layout of both the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, as well as the types and distributions of relevant receptors for each system.    </p>
