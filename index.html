            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I am a second year PhD student in the Qi Wangâ€™s Neural Engineering Control Lab. I am very interested in understanding the role the locus coeruleus plays in shaping decision making through the use of neuromodulation and electrophysiology. In the past I have worked with non-human primates at Arizona State University studying the neural control of real arm movement, as well as on optimization problems in neural decoding through computational modeling. My current work looks at how optogenetic stimulation of the LC can modulate and control cortical EEG signals. I hope to translate this project into a closed-loop system to optimize brain stimulation based on real-time oscillatory dynamics in the brain. Outside of the lab, I love playing chess, watching hometown sports, and spending time with my family and friends.
